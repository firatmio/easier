## ✨ About The Project

**Easier** is an open-source initiative dedicated to simplifying the developer experience. We create intuitive, high-level wrappers for popular frameworks across various programming languages.

Our mission is to:
*   **Reduce Boilerplate:** Write less, do more. Focus on your application's logic, not on repetitive setup code.
*   **Flatten the Learning Curve:** Get started with powerful tools faster than ever before.
*   **Improve Readability:** Create clean, elegant, and maintainable code with a simplified syntax.

We believe that powerful tools don't have to be complicated. `Easier` abstracts away the complexity without sacrificing the underlying functionality.

## 🚀 Currently Available Wrappers

Our collection of wrappers is constantly growing. Here is what we currently support:

| Language | Framework | Available Modules | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **🐍 Python** | `Firebase` | `auth`, `firestore`, `realtime`, `storage` | ✅ Actively Developed |
| **📜 JavaScript** | `Firebase` | `auth`, `firestore`, `realtimedb`, `storage` | ✅ Actively Developed |
| **🔷 TypeScript** | `Firebase` | `auth`, `firestore`, `realtimedb`, `storage` | ✅ Actively Developed |
